Stock news app that ranks the urgency the stocks in a of a users portfolio based the Twitter activity around the stocks

News gathering and sorting tool for stock information. Under production :)

The idea here is to use the twitter public streams to get some sense of the current interest in a stock, and then scrape news sources for information of that stock.

What will be built is a web scraper to gather news, a twitter scraper to get some sense of the current public sentiment of a stock and finally a user interface to interact with the information. This frontend will be created using react because I want to try it out :)
